"""
Cache Rate Performance Testing Tool - Streaming Token Metrics

Measures input tokens/s, time to first token (TTFT), and output tokens/s
at varying cache hit rates (0% to 100% in 5% increments) for OpenAI-compatible
inference APIs with automatic prompt caching.

This streaming version counts tokens based on when they are GENERATED (streamed),
not when requests complete. This matches vLLM's real-time metrics calculation.
